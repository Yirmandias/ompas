# The Scheme Interpreter

## Introduction

_Introduction to Scheme and Lisp:_

Scheme is derived from the functionnal language Lisp. Peter Norvig made a tutorial to implement a basic version in Python. The Rust implementation is based on Lis.py and Lispy.py (the second version integrates advanced features). The main idea developping our own Scheme Interpreter is first, to better understand how an interpreter works and how Scheme works. Another good point developping our custom interpreter is that we can add special features that we want to be implemented.
