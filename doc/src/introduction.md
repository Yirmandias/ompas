# Operational Model Planning and Acting System (OMPAS)

The OMPAS project is part of the Thesis "Planning from operational model for deliberation in robotics". The first aim is to implement a Refinement Acting Engine first described in _Automated Planning and Acting, 2016._

This wiki contains several sections:

- [Scheme](scheme/the-scheme-interpreter.md): A description of the Scheme interpreter that is at the core of the project.
- [RAE](rae/refinement-acting-engine-rae.md): A reinterpretation of the algorithms to adapt to Scheme
